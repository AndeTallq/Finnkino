Javascript project Two - Finnkino by Andreas Tallqvsist
    -I chose finnkino as I found the recommendation interesting and challenging and I enjoy movies.

   -Overall the build went rather smoothly. I really tried to make this "the correct way" by using functions and parameters. My wish was to uphold the philosophy ("DRY")- (Dont Repeat Yourself). 

    -Features that I've implemented:
        -Able to choose theatre from list.
        -each card has an image, name, plot and actors listed.
        -Basic media queries for device compatibility

    -Issues
        -Issues showing play times. Didn't figure out how to show the playtimes for a specific movie AND a specific theatre. 
        -Didn't have time to implement custom search, but it's something I intend to do in the future.
